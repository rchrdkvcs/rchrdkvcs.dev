## Overview

**rchrdkvcs.dev** is this very portfolio website you are browsing. It is built with Nuxt 4, styled with Nuxt UI components and Tailwind CSS, and uses Nuxt Content for project documentation — allowing each project to be described in detail using Markdown.

## The Problem

As a developer, having a personal portfolio is essential for showcasing work to potential employers and clients. I needed a site that was fast, easy to maintain, and allowed me to write detailed project case studies without dealing with CMS complexity.

## The Solution

I chose Nuxt 4 with Nuxt UI for a clean, component-driven architecture. Nuxt Content powers the project pages, enabling me to write project descriptions in Markdown while maintaining full control over the rendering and layout.

## Technical Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Nuxt 4 | Vue-based framework with SSR/SSG |
| Nuxt UI | Pre-built UI components |
| Nuxt Content | Markdown-based content management |
| Tailwind CSS | Utility-first styling |

## Key Features

### Monochrome Design
The site uses a deliberate monochrome color palette with sharp edges (0 border-radius), creating a distinctive, developer-focused aesthetic that stands out from typical portfolio templates.

### Project Showcase
Each project has its own dedicated page rendered from Markdown files, providing detailed case studies with:
- Technical stack breakdown
- Problem/solution narrative
- Architecture diagrams
- Lessons learned

### Responsive Layout
The site is fully responsive with a collapsible navigation menu on mobile devices.

### Performance
Built with Nuxt 4's latest optimizations:
- Server-side rendering for SEO
- Automatic code splitting
- Optimized image loading with @nuxt/image

## Design Choices

The design is intentionally minimal:
- **JetBrains Mono** font throughout for a developer feel
- **Grayscale palette** for a clean, professional look
- **Zero border-radius** for sharp, distinctive edges
- **Minimal animations** keeping the focus on content

## Lessons Learned

Building my own portfolio was a great exercise in restraint — knowing when to stop adding features and focus on content quality. Using Nuxt Content for project documentation proved to be an excellent choice, as it separates content from presentation while keeping everything in the same repository.
