## 5 Stars, 1 Fork

My most popular repo by the numbers. ox_lib is one of the most widely used UI libraries in the FiveM ecosystem, and this reskin gives it a facelift that server owners have been looking for.

## What It Replaces

The default ox_lib UI is functional but generic. This reskin overhauls:

- **Menus** — Better visual hierarchy, improved contrast, modern look
- **Notifications** — Cleaner animation and styling
- **Context panels** — Proper spacing, better typography

## Drop-In Install

No configuration, no code changes. Download the build, drop it into your ox_lib folder, restart the server. That simplicity is intentional — FiveM server owners aren't always developers, and the install process should reflect that.

## The Overflow Fix

One of the most requested fixes: the default ox_lib menus could overflow the screen with long lists. The reskin caps menu height at 60vh with a scrollable container. Small detail, but it was the #1 complaint from users.

## Versioning

The project follows semantic versioning with proper release branches (`release/v1.0.1`, `release/v1.0.2`), making it easy for server owners to track what changed between updates.
