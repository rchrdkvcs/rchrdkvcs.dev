## Not My Project — But I'm Part of It

Just Fucking Use Vue.js is a community-driven open-source organization. I'm a member, not the creator. The org exists to promote the Vue.js ecosystem through well-crafted websites and learning content.

The idea is simple: Vue.js is an outstanding framework that often gets overlooked in favor of alternatives for non-technical reasons. This organization aims to change that.

## The Organization's Projects

> **justfuckingusevuejs.com** — The main site. A love letter to Vue.js and why you should be using it. _8 stars._

> **blog.justfuckingusevuejs.com** — A collaborative blog focused on producing high-quality Vue.js and Nuxt learning material. Open to contributions from all skill levels. _10 stars._

> **justfuckingusenuxt.com** — Dedicated to making the case for Nuxt as the default choice for Vue.js applications. _5 stars._

> **justfuckingusenuxtui.com** — A showcase for Nuxt UI, demonstrating why it's a compelling component library. _6 stars, 1 fork._

## Why I Joined

The organization's philosophy resonates with me. I build almost everything with Vue and Nuxt, and I believe the ecosystem deserves more visibility. Being part of a community that actively works on that — through code, not just opinions — is valuable.

## The Blog's Approach

What makes the blog stand out is its focus on **high-efficiency learning material**. The content isn't optimized for clicks — it's structured for actual understanding, with real-world examples and practical use cases. Contributors are credited as authors and can promote their work freely.
