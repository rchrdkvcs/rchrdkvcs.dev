## Overview

**Five Stars** is a showcase website built for a GTA 5 RolePlay game server. The site serves as the public-facing identity of the server, providing information about the community, its rules, and how to join. Future development will include a whitelist questionnaire system.

## The Problem

The gaming community needed a professional website to establish credibility and attract new players. They also needed a way to filter incoming players through a whitelist process to maintain the quality of their roleplay experience.

## The Solution

I developed a modern, visually engaging website that captures the atmosphere of the game while providing all necessary information for potential players. The design emphasizes the community aspect of the server.

## Technical Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Next.js | React framework for SSR/SSG |
| Tailwind CSS | Responsive styling |
| Framer Motion | Cinematic scroll animations |

## Key Features

### Landing Page
A cinematic hero section with a video background that immediately immerses visitors in the GTA 5 atmosphere.

### Server Information
Detailed sections about:
- Server rules and guidelines
- Community values
- Staff team presentation
- How to connect to the server

### Staff Section
A dedicated section showcasing the server's staff team with their roles and responsibilities, building trust with potential new members.

### Responsive Design
The website is fully responsive with special attention to mobile users, as many gaming community members browse on their phones.

## Planned Features

### Whitelist Questionnaire
The next major feature will be an integrated questionnaire system where potential players must demonstrate their understanding of roleplay rules before being granted access to the server. This will include:

- **Multi-step form** with progress tracking
- **Scenario-based questions** to test roleplay knowledge
- **Automated scoring** with configurable pass thresholds
- **Admin dashboard** for reviewing borderline applications
- **Discord integration** for automatic role assignment upon approval

## Design

The design follows a dark theme inspired by the GTA 5 aesthetic:

- **Dark backgrounds** with neon accent colors
- **Cinematic typography** for headings
- **Smooth scroll animations** that enhance the storytelling

## Lessons Learned

Building a website for a gaming community taught me the importance of understanding the target audience. The design choices (dark theme, cinematic feel) were directly informed by the community's preferences and the game's aesthetic. Engaging with the community early in the design process led to higher satisfaction with the final product.
