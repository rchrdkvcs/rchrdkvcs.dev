## Overview

**Krem Pizzéria** is a presentation website created for a Hungarian restaurant. The project showcases the restaurant's identity through a clean, modern design with smooth animations and an intuitive navigation experience.

## The Problem

The restaurant needed an online presence that would reflect the quality and atmosphere of their establishment. They wanted a website that was visually appealing, easy to navigate, and would help attract new customers while providing essential information to existing ones.

## The Solution

I designed and developed a multi-section website with a focus on visual storytelling and user experience. The design was first prototyped in Figma, then implemented with Next.js for optimal performance and SEO.

## Technical Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Next.js | React framework with SSG for performance |
| Tailwind CSS | Utility-first CSS for responsive design |
| Framer Motion | Scroll-triggered animations |
| Figma | UI/UX design and prototyping |

## Key Sections

### Hero
A full-screen hero section with a high-quality background image and the restaurant's tagline, creating an immediate visual impact.

### About
Tells the story of the restaurant, its history, and its commitment to quality ingredients. Features a parallax scrolling effect.

### Menu
An interactive menu section organized by categories (pizzas, pastas, desserts, drinks). Each item displays the name, description, and price with hover effects.

### Contact
A contact section with the restaurant's address, phone number, opening hours, and an embedded map. Includes a reservation form.

## Design Process

The design was created in Figma following a warm, inviting color palette inspired by Italian cuisine:

- **Primary**: Warm terracotta tones
- **Secondary**: Olive green accents
- **Typography**: A combination of serif (headings) and sans-serif (body) fonts

## Performance

The website achieves excellent performance metrics:

- **Lighthouse Performance**: 98/100
- **First Contentful Paint**: 0.8s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: 1.2s
- **Time to Interactive**: 1.1s

These scores were achieved through:
- Static site generation (SSG)
- Optimized image loading with Next.js Image component
- Minimal JavaScript bundle size

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced the importance of the design-first approach. Starting with detailed Figma mockups significantly reduced development time and resulted in a more polished final product. The client was involved in the design review process, which helped align expectations early on.
